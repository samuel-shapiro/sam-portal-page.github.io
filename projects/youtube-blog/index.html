      <p style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">The layout of YouTube has come a long way since its humble beginnings in 2005.
        On February 14, three PayPal employees- Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim-
        made history when they registered the domain name, and in April when the first video
        “Me at the zoo.” was uploaded. Since then, the website has changed its layout eighteen times.

        <br>
        <br>

        In the beginning, the site had many of the raw features still found today, but a very
        unattractive and confusing presentation. While essential features such as “Related Videos”,
        “Subscribe”, and “Comments” were present, the site was cluttered, blocky, and featured a grey
        color palette. In November of 2006, when Google acquired YouTube, they adopted there signature
        red logo and the site became more organized. The home page displayed “Featured Videos”, and a
        tab system of navigation was displayed at the top. Later, in December, the layout of the video
        links changed from a list style to a grid system, utilizing more of the page's real estate.

        <br>
        <br>

        In July of 2009, the site began cleansing itself of the grey backdrops, instead giving the videos
        a white background. In 2010, the site began getting rid of the blocky borders around links,
        letting the links become pure text. In 2011, the site implemented the “Recommended for You” feature,
        an essential component of the modern algorithm the site uses. The grid structure also became more dynamic,
        allowing different types of categories to be displayed in a hierarchical fashion. In 2014, the final grid
        system was established, with the vertical axis displaying categories and the horizontal axis displaying
        videos within those categories.

        In my next post, I will dive into the features and layout of the last two years.

      <h2 style="  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;"> <u> YouTube's Current Layout </u> </h2>
      <img src="images/youtube-dark-mode.jpg" alt="Me at the zoo." style="width:50%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <p>After years of changes, the newest YouTube layout introduced the most extreme changes.
        To start, their logo itself changed, replacing the “Tube” incased in a red rectangle with
        the red play button instead placed to the side next to the regular text.

        <br>
        <br>

        The homepage of youtube retains the grid layout of its predecessors, but with an
        emphasis on what is actually displayed. The top of the page houses eight “Recommended”
        videos, which is selected via an algorithm that suggest viewings based off your most
        recent videos watched. Below that, the website has begun focusing on the creators
        themselves, with the user's frequently watched channels each getting their own row and
        four videos displayed. The menu bar has now shifted to the left of the page, and remains
        accessible via a hamburger menu when a specific video is being watched.
        <br>
        <br>

        The site also introduced two new features that will radically change the user experience.
        One of these features is the “Dark Theme”, which makes the page very dark to reduce glare and
        highlight the content itself. They also built the site on top of the open source Javascript
        library Polymer, which allows them to easily and quickly bring new changes to the site.
        One such feature, shown on the iPhone app, is to double tap the video to fast-forward or rewind.
