  <h1>Fahkwang</h1>
  <br>
  <h2> History </h2>
  <p> Fahkwang is developed by the Cadson Demak design firm, which was founded in 2002. It is a Thai and Latin Sans Serif font family inspired by headlines in old Thai newspapers, and utilizes a high contrast. </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Usage </h2>
  <p> Fahkwang is most popular in the US and Japan, with more than 135k times used. Fahkwang is currently featured in more than 1k websites. It is primarily a display type, as it is more decorative than it is pragmatic, thus works better at larger font sizes. </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Verdict </h2>
  <p> We were unable to find any websites using this font by searching for it. We appreciate its simplicity, minimal styling, and the 12 specific font styles that you can use. Its personality is both simple yet bold and unique. </p>
